Embarking on your GitHub Pages journey is an exciting step towards establishing your online presence. Whether you're a developer, designer, or enthusiast eager to share your projects, this beginner's guide will walk you through what to expect as you dive into the world of GitHub Pages.

Understanding GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is a hosting service provided by GitHub that allows you to turn your GitHub repositories into accessible websites. It's an excellent way to showcase your portfolio, projects, or personal website without the need for external hosting.

Key Expectations for Beginners
1. Repository Naming Convention
When setting up your GitHub Pages site, keep in mind the importance of the repository name. The repository should be named <username>.github.io, replacing <username> with your actual GitHub username. This specific naming convention ensures that GitHub recognizes it as your primary GitHub Pages repository.

2. Basic HTML Knowledge
While GitHub Pages supports various technologies, having a basic understanding of HTML is beneficial. Your main page, usually named index.html, serves as the entry point for your site. You can add other HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to enhance your site's design and functionality.

3. Content Creation
Start by creating the foundational content for your GitHub Pages site. The index.html file is where you'll structure the main page. You can include text, images, links, and even embed interactive elements. Experiment with different HTML tags to tailor the content to your preferences.
